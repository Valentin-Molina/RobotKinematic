# RobotKinematic

A small pet project focused on exploring 2D robotic kinematics, including both forward and inverse motion.
Built in C++ with SFML for interactive visualization and Eigen for all vector and matrix computations.

The goal is to create a lightweight, hands-on playground to experiment with robotic motion and better understand the geometry behind it.
